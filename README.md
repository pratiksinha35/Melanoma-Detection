# Melanoma Detection

Detecting melanoma, a potentially lethal form of skin cancer responsible for 75% of skin cancer deaths, is of paramount importance for early intervention and improved patient outcomes. Developing an effective solution to accurately identify melanoma through image analysis not only holds the promise of saving lives but also has the potential to alleviate the substantial manual effort required in the diagnostic process. In pursuit of this objective, we have created a sophisticated convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based model that leverages the power of deep learning to analyze skin images. Additionally, we have explored advanced data augmentation strategies to enhance the model's robustness and generalization capabilities. This technology, combining the strength of CNN architecture and innovative data augmentation techniques, emerges as a critical tool for providing dermatologists with a reliable means of evaluating skin images and promptly alerting them to the presence of melanoma. Such an integrated approach can significantly enhance the efficiency and precision of melanoma detection, thereby contributing to the advancement of early diagnosis and intervention strategies.
